\section{Conclusion}
To conclude, this lab, we investigated the properties of LEDs through various measurements. By examining the relationship between voltage, current, and emitted intensity we were able to find the forward bias of the LED. Furthermore, we saw how a temperature decrease affected the LED through a freeze out. This freeze out demonstrated that the removal of the doping resulted in a wider bandgap and a shorter wavelength.
