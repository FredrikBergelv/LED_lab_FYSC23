\section{Introduction}
Semiconductors are becoming more and more important for our society. One important application of semiconductors is light emitting diodes (LEDs) \cite{hofmann2015} which are used in e.g. displays and lighting, but also have application in medicine. LEDs also show a much better efficiency than earlier lightbulbs, thus decreasing energy consumption \cite{hofmann2015}, something which is becoming increasingly more important. The basic part of the LED, the pn-junction, is also used in solar cells and can be used to produce energy from light \cite{hofmann2015}.
