\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Part 1}
At which wavelength does the LED shine? Is the light emission uniform in the visible
wavelength range for a White LED? Why/why not?
How does the current depend on the voltage?
Can you explain qualitatively why the LED behaves like this?
Why does the voltage need to be applied in one specific direction for the LED to shine?
How does the light depend on the current/voltage applied? Why?
When using different LED colours, do they behave the same (if enough time is available)?
Why/why not?
